Have something in your fridge that you need to use before it goes bad? Use Stew and Brew to find a yummy recipe before it's too late! After dinner, try out a new local brewery and support small businesses with a yummy Brewery. Find one near you with our Brewery finder!

## Description

Stew and Brew is a dual purposed website that allows you to search for recipes that fit your dietary needs, whatever they may be, and it also lets you search for local breweries. When you search in one of these search bars, it will populate 3 search results that you can click on to retrieve more information, it will redirect you to the page that wields the results you are looking for. If one of the three results isn't what you're looking for, click the more button and three more will populate under the original three. Click the Save button to save your favorite recipes. You can access your favorite recipes by clicking the Saved button in the top right corner of the webpage.
